<h2>Some Basics Now</h2>
<hr>

<h3>About Title</h3>
<p title="About Title">
  If you move the mouse over this paragraph, the title will show as a tooltip.
</p>

<h3>About Links</h3>
<p>
  <a href="http://www.google.com" title="correct link">Google</a> <!-- The quotation marks around attribute values are optional, but highly recommended. -->
  <a href="www.google.com" title="incorrect link">Google not here</a> <!-- If you don't put http:// it will assume its a sub directory/file under current location -->
</p>

<h3>About Images</h3>
<p title="About Images">
  <img src="blablabla.jpg" alt="Picture Not Found."> <!-- the alt attribute provides an alternative text when element not available. Can be read by screen readers, say for blind people. -->
</p>

<h3>About Paragraphs</h3>
<p>
This paragraph
contains a lot of lines
in the source code,
but the browser
ignores it.
</p>

<pre>
  So, the way to actually take spaces and new lines into considerations is to use tag &lt;pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 

  This is called preformatted text.

  Hope you already noticed the difference in fonts(usually " Courier") and our spa ce  s actually works.
</pre>
<pre style="font-family:verdana">
  Of course if you are not happy about the preset font-family, just use style to change it. The default for html is "verdana"
</pre>
